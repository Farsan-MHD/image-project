                <p class="pera3">  Maui County is the only county in Hawaii that is composed of multiple islands. Kahoolawe was once used by the navy for target practice and remains uninhabited. Lana'i and Moloka'i, however, are home to small, tight-knit populations. Many Moloka'i and Lana'i residents come to Maui often to take care of business and shop at the only Costco in the county. Lanai is the most accessible island for visitors and is home to a booming population of spinner dolphins and vibrant coral reefs. For those interested in visiting Lana'i, Hawaii Ocean Project offers a fantastic snorkel cruise that explores the island's coast. This makes for a great day trip. </p>

            <p class="pera4">  1.2 million years ago, the island of Molokini, Kaho'olawe, Moloka'i, Lana'i, and Maui were all connected. This 5,600 square mile island was 40% larger than the Big Island is today. This colossal landmass was called Maui Nui. As the volcanos that made up the island slowly eroded and the ice ages came to an end, the sea began to fill the island's low-lying areas. The islands finally became separated 200,000 years ago. </p>
            <p class="pera5">  Molokini's last eruption was about 230,000 years ago. As eruptions ceased, Molokini slowly eroded into the sea. Today the crater is home to one of the most unique and vibrant reefs in the world. Molokini is a sanctuary for over 250 types of fish and has become a mecca for snorkelers. A visit to Molokini aboard Kai Kanani is one of the best ways to experience the crater. Kai Kanani offers a sunrise snorkel tour and is one of the first boats to reach the crater in the morning.  </p>
            <p class="pera6">  Dense rainforests, alpine deserts, sheer mountains ranges: Maui is home to many different microclimates. A microclimate is a climate in a small area, specifically when it varies from the climate in the surrounding regions. On a short drive, you might pass through both rainforest and desert. This is the reason for the saying, "if you don't like the weather on Maui, just drive five minutes." </p>
