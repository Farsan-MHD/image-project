                <p class="pera2">  On July 4, 1884 France presented the United States with an incredible birthday gift: the Statue of Liberty! Without its pedestal it’s as tall as a 15-story building. She represents the United States. But the world-famous Statue of Liberty standing in New York Harbor was built in France. The statue was presented to the U.S., taken apart, shipped across the Atlantic Ocean in crates, and rebuilt in the U.S. It was France’s gift to the American people. </p>
                <p class="pera3">  It all started at dinner one night near Paris in 1865. A group of Frenchmen were discussing their dictator-like emperor and the democratic government of the U.S. They decided to build a monument to American freedom—and perhaps even strengthen French demands for democracy in their own country. At that dinner was the sculptor Frédéric-Auguste Bartholdi (bar-TOLE-dee). He imagined a statue of a woman holding a torch burning with the light of freedom. </p>

            <p class="pera4"> The Statue of Liberty, aka Liberty Enlightening the World, is one well-known landmark – it's one of the most famous and beloved icons in the world. Erected in the bay of New York in 1886, it’s the first monumental thing many European immigrants saw of the USA on their arrival day.   </p>
            <p class="pera5">  Yes, each of the seven spikes on her crown represent the seven oceans and the seven continents of the world. This is said to represent the universal concept of liberty. It's not only about fashion! </p>
            <p class="pera6">  Her head even spent some time in Paris at the World's Fair before it was given as a gift to celebrate the centenary of the American revolution and the friendship among the two countries. That's cute, right?  </p>
