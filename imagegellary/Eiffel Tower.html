                <p class="pera2"> The Eiffel Tower — or, la Tour Eiffel — has long been one of the world's most recognizable landmarks, symbolizing the romance and ingenuity of the City of Light. Designed as the centerpiece of the 1889 World's Fair, it was meant to commemorate the centennial of the French Revolution and highlight France's modern industrial prowess on the world stage.   </p>
                <p class="pera3">  And that it did. The tower's construction — finished in just two years, two months, and five days — was considered a marvel of precision and speed. Gustave Eiffel's civil engineering firm used a whopping 7,300 tons of iron and 2.5 million rivets, and the result stood triumphant over the Champs de Mars, receiving more than two million visitors during the fair.  </p>

            <p class="pera4">  There’s more to this iconic landmark than meets the eye. Despite the more than 300 million people who have visited since its debut, La Dame de Fer still has a few secrets to share. Here are some of our favorite little-known facts about the Eiffel Tower. </p>
            <p class="pera5">  While the now-famous silhouette has been emulated worldwide in places like Las Vegas, Prague, Tianducheng (China), and Paris, Texas, the design wasn’t without its detractors. A "Protest against the Tower of Monsieur Eiffel” letter, signed by the likes of Guy de Maupassant (who famously dined at the Eiffel Tower's restaurant every day so he wouldn't have to look at it), Alexandre Dumas, and other well-known artists, was published in the newspaper Le Temps before the project’s completion. The letter argued that the tower would be “a gigantic black factory chimney, its barbarous mass overwhelming and humiliating all our monuments and belittling our works of architecture, which will just disappear before this stupefying folly.” </p>
            <p class="pera6">  Of course, in defiance of such protests, the Eiffel Tower did see the light of day and has stood the test of time. It remains one of the most visited monuments in the world, welcoming almost seven million visitors a year.  </p>
