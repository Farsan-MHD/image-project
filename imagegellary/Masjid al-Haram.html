It is so-called because the doors are open to Muslims all over the world but with no offense, non-Muslims are not allowed. It is also called The Great Mosque of Makkah.

This signifies unity among everybody. In this blog, we look at the Masjid Al-Haram’s history and interesting facts about it.  </p>
                <p class="pera3"> Masjid al-haram is called the grand mosque as it is the largest mosque in the world covering an area of 88.2 acres of land (originally). The house of worship has been built and rebuilt after getting destroyed by natural calamities. Today, the pillars stand tall protecting the Great Black Stone standing in all its glory. Masjid al-haram is the single holiest site in Islam, the holiest place for Muslims to exist on the face of the earth.  </p>

            <p class="pera4">  The Forbidden Mosque or the Masjid al-haram is the most beautiful. It is a sight to behold. You can feel the presence of Allah when you are between the pillars. It is said that the mosque never sleeps. Millions of Muslims go there to repent, ask for forgiveness, and worship the Almighty. </p>
            <p class="pera5">  You can see the holy Kaaba in the center of the masjid standing tall and beautiful. Surrounding the Kaaba or the house of Allah, people perform the Tawaf or the circling ritual which is a part of the Hajj and Umrah pilgrimages. Muslims wear special Ihram clothing to adhere to the fifth pillar of Islam. When the sun is out, the gleaming marbles reflect the holiness of the people and during the night, millions of lights flood the grand mosque in the most magnificent way to throw light on the minarets who watch over the gate. </p>
            <p class="pera6">  Many Muslims are seen to be overwhelmed by their repentance and by being among so many people who have the same holy intention at heart. The aura of the mosque is such that it will make your faith stronger as you witness everything that you learned in the holy book, the Quran. </p>

        <h2> Masjid al-Haram History </h2>

        <div class="perabox2">

            <p class="pera7">  The history of the Al-Haram mosque begins before the beginning of the earth. The book of the Quran says that the mosque was built even before the creation of mankind. It is supposed to mirror the place of Worship for the angels from the heavens. The mosque is a reflection of ‘The Worship Place for Angels’ or al-Baytu l-Ma’mur. </p>
            <p class="pera7">  According to the Gregorian calendar, the construction of this mosque began in the 7th century by Caliph Omar Ibn al-Khattab. The number of pilgrims was increasing hence the walls were reconstructed further around the Kaaba. In 777, Abbasid Caliph Al Mahdi demolished the original mosque and came out with a grid plan. He then built a larger mosque around the Kaaba. There are many buildings in that mosque that date back to 1571. </p>
            <p class="pera7">  The mosque was renovated to be expanded from 1950 to accommodate more people into its sanctuary. The most recent construction was done in 2018. After this, it became the world’s largest mosque set to be home to 2.5 million worshippers in a land of 187 acres. </p>
